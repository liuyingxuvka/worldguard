## FlowGuard Project Rules

This project uses FlowGuard for non-trivial maintenance, feature work, bug
fixes, refactors, tests, release work, project upgrades, and evidence-sensitive
process changes.

FlowGuard repository:
https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard

FlowGuard agent skill suite:
- Primary agent surface: `.agents/skills/`
- Default entry skill: `.agents/skills/model-first-function-flow/SKILL.md`
- Complete AI-agent setup means the agent can read `AGENTS.md` and all
  FlowGuard sibling `SKILL.md` files under `.agents/skills/`.
- The Python `flowguard` module/CLI is executable check support, not the
  AI-agent skill installation surface.

Project FlowGuard record:
- Manifest: `.flowguard/project.toml`
- Machine log: `.flowguard/adoption_log.jsonl`
- Human log: `docs/flowguard_adoption_log.md`

Current adoption record:
- FlowGuard check-engine version: `0.52.6`
- FlowGuard schema version: `1.0`

Before non-trivial work:
1. Verify the real FlowGuard check engine:
   `python -c "import flowguard; print(flowguard.SCHEMA_VERSION)"`
2. Check the installed check-engine version:
   `python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('flowguard'))"`
3. Audit the project record:
   `python -m flowguard project-audit --root .`
4. Compare the installed version with `.flowguard/project.toml`.
5. If the installed version is newer, run:
   `python -m flowguard project-upgrade --root .`
   This updates the project record and scans existing FlowGuard artifacts,
   model evidence, tests, docs, and guidance for deterministic upgrades into
   the current FlowGuard shape. Use `--records-only` only when intentionally
   scoping out artifact/model/test upgrade scanning.
   Then rerun affected models/tests before broad confidence and record the result.
6. If the installed version is older than the project record, stop and connect
   a current FlowGuard check engine before claiming FlowGuard confidence.

FlowGuard runtime guidance is latest-schema-first: old artifacts may be
detected and upgraded at project/tool boundaries, but normal route logic should
not preserve long-lived compatibility branches for obsolete fields, aliases, or
wrappers.

Default replacement means dispose the old path, old field, alias, wrapper, or
fallback unless compatibility or preservation is explicitly requested. If
compatibility is explicit, record the preserved surface, compatibility intent,
and current evidence; otherwise delete, block, migrate, delegate, repair, or
scope it out with a concrete reason.

Field-bearing work should use or update FieldLifecycleMesh: high-level behavior
models include behavior-bearing fields, while child/leaf field rows account all
discovered fields and record owner, readers, writers, projection, lifecycle,
and old-field disposition.

UI runnable claims and file/work-package claims need current UI click-through
or artifact-payload evidence gates before broad done/release confidence.

Non-trivial rough-plan discussion, multi-skill/tool workflow setup, staged
execution, install/sync, release/archive/publish, post-change owner scans, and
final process claims enter `flowguard-development-process-flow` first as the
development-process simulator. Record `plan_detailing`, `agent_workflow`, and
`execution_freshness` modes; delegate to PlanDetailing or
AgentWorkflowRehearsal only when explicit or simulator-selected.

After non-trivial FlowGuard-managed work, let DevelopmentProcessFlow consume
post-change scan signals for changed artifacts, skipped routes, stale evidence,
open obligations, or split/reduction pressure. The scan output routes each gap
to the owning specialist, such as Model-Test Alignment, Architecture
Reduction, StructureMesh, ModelMesh, TestMesh, or AgentWorkflowRehearsal.

Do not create a fake local FlowGuard replacement. Do not claim full FlowGuard
completion from an AGENTS/manifest/log update alone; executable model checks,
tests, replay, and closure evidence still need to be current for the claim.
