# Changelog

## v0.7.0 - 2026-07-31

- Replaced former shallow task-local prediction/revision shapes with one strict
  current schema binding task purpose, independent coverage, assumptions,
  unknowns, exact iteration predecessor, and later-iteration prior gap ids
  bound to their current fingerprint.
- Added content-addressed observation, native execution-depth, semantic
  rollout, original-scenario, and real-holdout receipts; candidate closure now
  derives seven predictive gap classes and evidence independence instead of
  accepting caller-authored gap, progress, or `PASS` strings.
- Made fact activation an intermediate same-task/same-owner revalidation
  handoff. It can no longer emit `model_closed_for_task`.
- Added exact stall, iteration-limit, external-input, tamper, holdout-alias,
  rejection, rollback, and multi-evidence regression coverage, and extended
  FlowGuard/SkillGuard ownership for the task-local closure check.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-07-31

- Added task-local world-model deepening with explicit prediction, gap
  transitions, next actions, progress, and terminal reasons.
- Added evidence-bound fact-revision lifecycle fields and synchronized the
  bundled consumer runtime with the source implementation.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-07-30

- Added task-local four-valued fact revision with independent positive and
  negative support, visible contradictions, strict-rule closure, and no
  explosion into unrelated facts.
- Added immutable revision previews and evidence-bound activation with exact
  base/preview identity, preservation checks, contradiction acknowledgement,
  current regression and holdout evidence, and duplicate transaction blocking.
- Added the native CLI, Codex skill route, target-owned semantic check,
  FlowGuard regression model, and behavior-commitment ownership for the new
  revision path.
- Restored current source/package/bundled-runtime identity and expanded the
  author-side SkillGuard contract from five to six exact target checks.

## v0.4.1 - 2026-07-22

- Adopt SkillGuard 0.4 bounded evidence lifecycle without changing WorldGuard's target-owned semantic checks.
- Remove copied FlowGuard author-control surfaces from the consumer repository and keep one WorldGuard maintenance unit.
- Preserve exact consumer projection parity and fail closed on stale installation evidence.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-07-19

- Corrected release-readiness validation so author-side SkillGuard control stays
  in the source repository while the installed consumer contains zero
  `.skillguard` paths.
- Added exact source/manifest/installed consumer inventory and hash checks.
- Removed normal-runtime readers for retired claim, claim-atom, world-model,
  and semantic-coverage aliases; old files now require direct upgrade migration.
- Synchronized package metadata, bundled runtime, installed consumer, Git tag,
  and GitHub Release identity for the release.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-07-18

Single-entry internal-Guard source candidate. This source heading does not by
itself assert a Git tag, hosted GitHub Release, or installed projection.

- Kept `worldguard` as the sole public Codex skill and package console.
- Formalized EventGuard, AgentGuard, SpaceGuard, ResourceGuard, CausalGuard,
  ConflictGuard, and NormGuard as seven complete internal routes with their own
  expectation/prediction boundary, native response, semantic validation, and
  visible terminal behavior.
- Added exact root/bundled runtime parity and source-version identity checks.
- Removed current authority from the retired `worldguard/skillguard_depth.py`
  validation path without adding an alias, fallback, or compatibility reader.
- Treats the public child-entrypoint contraction as the breaking minor step
  appropriate for the pre-1.0 package line.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-07-15

Purpose-declared world-claim and model-mesh release.

- Required each WorldGuard model to declare the concrete impossible,
  inconsistent, underspecified, conflicting, or unsupported world state it is
  intended to block for the current task.
- Added purpose, boundary, witness, counterexample, safe-claim, and closure
  evidence across unit contracts and model meshes while preserving the
  existing Event, Agent, Space, Resource, Causal, Conflict, and Norm families.
- Strengthened mesh ownership, handoff, freshness, cycle, field lifecycle,
  sibling impact, and ledger-preservation checks for multi-model claims.
- Replaced former SkillGuard authorities with target-owned declared checks
  under generic immutable-receipt supervision and fixed enforced closure.
- Updated package code, examples, tests, OpenSpec records, FlowGuard evidence,
  and the maintained WorldGuard skill.

## v0.1.2 - 2026-07-07

- Added `python -m worldguard` as a thin wrapper around the existing CLI.
- Hardened the WorldGuard SkillGuard contract boundary so duplicate SkillGuard-owned execution paths are invalid.
- Added OpenSpec/FlowGuard release tracking for simulation readiness and local install synchronization.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-06-27

- Added SkillGuard runtime-contract governance for the installed WorldGuard Codex skill materials.
- Synchronized installed skill copies with accepted source material and local git evidence.
- Recorded release-scope validation so route selection, evidence gates, quality floors, and closure boundaries remain visible before completion claims.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-06-22

First source-only release.

### Added

- Installable Python package `worldguard`.
- CLI checks for unit contracts and model meshes.
- Seven guard families: Event, Agent, Space, Resource, Causal, Conflict, and Norm.
- `GuardContract` runtime for unit-level world-claim checks.
- `ModelMeshContract` runtime for multi-model authority, handoff, freshness, cycle, and ledger-preservation checks.
- Toy fuel-cell fixture for regression checks.
- Generic model-mesh example fixture.
- Repository copy of the WorldGuard Codex skill.
- OpenSpec and FlowGuard records for the MVP and ModelMesh work.

### Boundaries

- This release does not claim real fuel-cell physics, legal compliance, safety certification, deployment readiness, market truth, or business-strategy proof.
- This release is source-only and does not include binary installers or packaged desktop assets.
